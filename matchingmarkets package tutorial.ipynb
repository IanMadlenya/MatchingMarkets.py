    "# \"`matchingmarkets`\" simulation package tutorial (part 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This package simulates matching markets (without money). The simulated markets can be for a single period (static) or evolve over multiple periods (dynamic). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a single period matching market could be matching high school students to schools, which is done at once for all high school freshmen each year. In contrast, a dynamic market could be an organ transplant list, matching patients to organs. In the transplant list, patients and organs arrive in the market at different times, and leave the market at different times (either by receiving a transplant, or death).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's intuitive that methods built for static markets won't necessarily perform well in dynamic markets, because the decision of *when* to match is now important.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the problem of static matching markets has been well studied over many decades, the study of dynamic matching markets is recent and sparse in comparison. For instance, [Akbarpour et al. (2014)](http://economics.mit.edu/files/10375) is the first known publication to study the theory of dynamic matching in general matching markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's reasonable to assume that the lack of formal theory around dynamic matching is because of the sheer mathematical difficulty of proving results in this domain, and not because of lack of applicability, or interest (recall the 2012 [Nobel prize in economics](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2012/) was given to Shapley and Roth for their study of matching markets.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This lack of formal theory motivates this package, which is built to test user defined algorithms in a fairly general setting, with a focus on dynamic markets. The `matchingmarkets` package is built around the following concepts: various types of **Agents**, a **Market** containing the agents, **Algorithms** which decide *who* to match in the market and *how*, and **meta-Algorithms** which decide *when*, and with *who*, to implement the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explain these concepts, then use them to test the theoretical results in Akbarpour et al. (2014) using the package."
